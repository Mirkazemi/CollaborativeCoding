## Collaborative Coding

In this tutorial, we learn how to make a copy of repository and develope it in a group.

Github is a distributed version control and source code management tool. They provide developers to share software and code in collaboration. As a user in Github your can make a copy of codes of someone else and separately work on it. The action of making a copy of a software is called **fork**. Once you have forked a repo, you own your forked copy. This means that you can edit the contents of your forked repository without impacting the parent repo.

Please go to the https://github.com/Mirkazemi/HelloWorldProject
On the right hand side of the page you can find the fork button. Please click on it then you will have an independent copy of the **HelloWorldProject**.

When you create or fork a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.
