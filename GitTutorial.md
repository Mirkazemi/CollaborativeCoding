## Git: What is Git?

In this tutorial we review the basics of Git.

A: What is Git?

B: Git is a “control version system”.

A: What does it exactly do?

B: It tracks and records the changes to   the files.

A: So … we can recall specific versions of our files at any time.

B: Exactly. And moreover, it allows the people to collaborate  on a project and have their own version of project files on their local computers!

Git works based on the repositories and a Git repository is a folder called .git/ inside a project. The repository tracks and records all changes in a project. If we delete the .git/ folder, all the history of the changes are deleted. 

![logs_graph](https://github.com/Mirkazemi/CollaborativeCoding/blob/main/images/git_structure.png)

Git is a command line based tool although it is partially supported by many graphical user interfaces (e.g. some of code editors).  Thus is this tutorial we only focus using Git in the command line.

We also suppose that you have already installed git on your computer. For installation, you may follow these [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for Linux, Windows, macOS operating systems.

In order to check if the Git has already been installed, open a terminal and check the version of it:
```console
$ git --version
```




### Initial Configuration
All the commits in Git are stored based on the identity of the user thus the first step after installation of Git is to set name and email of the user.
```console
$ git config --global user.name "John Smith"
$ git config --global user.email "John.Smith@mail.com"
```
The ```--global``` means that name and email of the user are set for all of your repositories.  If you already set the configuration you can see the name and email of user by following commands:

```console
$ git config user.name
$ git config user.email
```

### Initiating a Git Repository 
Generally there are two methods for obtaining a repository. The first one is to convert a directory on your computer to a repository and the second one is to clone a remote repository. The second method will be explained in the sections related to using Github and Gitlab.

If you have a project folder that is not under version control then you first need to go to that directory.
```console
$ cd path/to/myproject
```
In this tutorial, we create a new project folder. 
```console
$ cd path/to/somewhere
$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
```
Now you are ready to initiate the a Git repository by typing:
```console
$ git init
```
### Tracking the files
Before going to the next step, we need to know the meaning of **tracked** and **untracked** files in a repository. The tracked files are those one for which you have a snapshot from the last changes. The untracked one are the files that have been edited but the last changes have not been tracked by Git. So if we create a new file (not an empty file) it is an untracked file until we ask the repository to record a snapshot of the file. Let's try it. We create a file, for example a Hello World python script and check how Git recognizes this file.

You can ask Git to basically ignore some file for tracking using a list file names in '.gitignore' file. Which files should not be tracked? The rule of thumb is that we are interested in tracking the files which are written by human (e.g. source codes) and not by a computer. For example, your code generate some files (e.g. results of a calculation). It is better to add the name of those file to '.gitignore' file.

Creating the file:
```console
$ echo "print(f'Hello World')" > helloworld.py
```
To check the status of the files in the repository we use the ```status``` option.
```console
$ git status
```
The output is like:
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	helloworld.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
It shows that ```helloworld.py``` is an untracked file.  We use the ```add``` and ```commit``` functions to add and commit changes to git.
The ```add``` recognizes the changes in the targeted file and places it in the staging area. The ```commit``` takes available changes in staging area and makes a snapshot of the current state repository and assigns it a hash. A hash is the identifier of a snapshot.

First we try the add function and then we check the status of the repository.
```console
$ git add helloworld.py
```
```console
$ git status
```
The output is:
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
  
	new file:   helloworld.py
```
The state of the repository tells us that ```helloworld.py``` is ready to be committed. So let's commit it and add a message using the ```-m``` option. The message should be a short description of the changes being committed.
```console
$ git commit -m "adding helloworld.py to the code"
```
### Commit history
After several commits you can look back to the history of the commits. Until now we only had a single commit, let’s make two other ones and then review the history of commits. The first commit was after we wrote ```helloworld.py```. For the second commit, we write the german and french version of hello world code. For the third one we edit all three files by adding associated language to the output of the print function.

Second commit:
```console
$ echo "print(f'Hallo Welt')" > hallowelt.py
$ echo "print(f'Bonjour le monde')" > bonjourlemonde.py
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adding German and French versions of Hello world."
```
In above, we wrote ```git add .``` or we could wrote ```git add *.py``` add all matching files. It is a faster way instead of typing the name of each file individually.

Third commit:
```console
$ echo "print(f'English: Hello World')" > helloworld.py
$ echo "print(f'German: Hallo Welt')" > hallowelt.py
$ echo "print(f'French: Bonjour le monde')" > bonjourlemonde.py
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Print the language in the output'
```

Now we have three commits (three snapshots from the repository). Let's have a look to them by typing:

```console
$ git log
```
The output is like below and shows the author information, time and date of commits, message of commits and a unique for each commit. 
```
YOUR_USERNAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Thu Feb 11 05:08:56 2021 +0100

    Print the language in the output

commit d5817901ca4877ae50a4334e0a7df0b92cbb62b2
YOUR_USERNAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Thu Feb 11 05:08:33 2021 +0100

    Adding German and French versions of Hello world.

commit 5d6f059b2cea94c0c4369c20c1883e03f5e6f314
YOUR_USERNAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Feb 10 21:37:11 2021 +0100

    adding helloworld.py to the code
```
There are many options to change the format of the output of ```git log``` but a simplest one is:
```console
$ git log --pretty=oneline
```
that shows the hash and message of each commit in one line:
```
21df35152a69052219edecbcf65b9df9406e807d Print the langauge in the output
d5817901ca4877ae50a4334e0a7df0b92cbb62b2 Adding German and French versions of Hello world.
5d6f059b2cea94c0c4369c20c1883e03f5e6f314 adding helloworld.py to the code
```
Now we can have an overview on all versions of our code. In the first version, we have a hello world code. In the second version, the french and german versions of the hello world were added and in the last one the output of all codes are changed. 

### Moving between different version of a code
Whenever you make a commit Git takes a snapshot of your repository so you can ask Git to recall the previous version of your code. For example, at the moment your code can print "language: Hello World" in three languages of english, german and french. Perhaps your colleague asks you for the previous version of the code that only prints "Hello World" in three languages. You do not need to edit your code to that version. Git memorizes every commits and you can ask Git to recall that version of your code using related hash:

```console
$ git checkout d5817901ca4877ae50a4334e0a7df0b92cbb62b2
```
Now all the files are changed to the previous version. Let's check it and see the content of the files:
```console
$ cat *.py
```

The files contents are:
```
print(f'French: Bonjour le monde')
print(f'German: Hallo Welt')
print(f'English: Hello World')
```

### Git Branching
Branching is a powerful tools for developing a software on different paths. For example, you have software tool that works propelry but you are asked to add a feature into it (e.g. adding a new data vidualization feature to present your results). You do not need to make changes in your last version on master branch. You can create a new branch for developing data visulaization and merge it later to the master branch.

Lets go back to our super simple example. Assume that we want to have english and german hello world programms that print in upper case and meanwhile we also work on adding Hello World in dutch (in lower case as before). Thus, we create a new branch based on the last commit and name it 'uppercase'. Then we add two codes for upper case Hello World in english and german. In parallel, we also work on the main branch and add lower case Hello World in dutch. If adding upper case Hello World is a succesful project we **merge** the uppercase branch with master branch. The below figure illustrate what is our plan for develping our software:

![logs_graph](https://github.com/Mirkazemi/CollaborativeCoding/blob/main/git-branches.png)

As you remember we moved to the second commit so first, we move back to the last commit in the master branch and check where am I:

Moving back to the last commit in the master branch:
```console
$ git checkout master
```

```console
$ git log --pretty=oneline
```
```
24ffa85cda50eb01058e2cacbd979dd3ef8f234a (HEAD -> master) Print the language in the output
e8652afcdf64cbd660806708e23d41e22a226a18 Adding German and French versions of Hello world.
bd7779eef0780cd6beb6d270045e143ec07bbfa3 adding helloworld.py to the code
```

Now we create a new branch and name it 'uppercase' for working on upper case features:
```console
$ git checkout -b uppercase
```
Let's check the repository log and we will see that the last commit is shared point between master and uupercase branches.
```console
$ git log --pretty=oneline
```
```
24ffa85cda50eb01058e2cacbd979dd3ef8f234a (HEAD -> uppercase, master) Print the language in the output
e8652afcdf64cbd660806708e23d41e22a226a18 Adding German and French versions of Hello world.
bd7779eef0780cd6beb6d270045e143ec07bbfa3 adding helloworld.py to the code
```
One may ask if we make change and commit the new commit will be on which branch, 'master' or 'uppercase'? You can check current branch using 'branch' function:
```console
$ git branch
```
And the output is:
```
  master
* uppercase
```
The '*' shows the current branch. We can switch between branches using 'checkout' function in the following format:
```console
$ git checkout branch_name
```
Now we add a code for uppercase print for english Hello World and we know that when we make a commit, the commit will be on the uppercase branch.

**U1** point in the figure:
```console
$ echo "print(f'ENGLISH: HELLO WORLD')" > helloworld_uppercase.py
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'adding uppercase of english helloworld'
```

**U2** point in the figure:
Upper case for german Hello World:
```console
$ echo "print(f'GERMAN: HALLO WELT')" > hallowelt_uppercase.py
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'adding uppercase of german helloworld'
```

Now, we completed the upper case project on the uppercase branch. In parallel we work on the master branch and add dutch hello world. First we move back to the master branch (we go back to the **C** point in the figure).

```console
$  git checkout master
```
To make sure that we are move to the correct snapshot of the repository we can use '--graph' option of the 'log' function:
```console
$  git log --all --graph 
```
The output shows the graph of the braches and commits history:
```

```
The **HEAD** is on the correct commit and we are on the master branch so we are ready to add Hello World in dutch.

Point **D** in the figure:
```console
$ echo "print(f'Dutch: Hallo Wereld')" > hallowereld.py
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'adding of dutch version of Hello World'
```
Let see how is the graph of the branches now:
```console
$  git log --all --graph 
```
```

```

Now we can merge the uppercase branch into the master branch using **merge** function. Please note that we are on the master branch.

```console
$  git merge uppercase
```

And if we look at the graph of the repository logs, we figure out that it is identical to our figure.
```console
$  git log --all --graph 
```
